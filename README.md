# Project Description

A scrollable android app that contains a list of over 1000 quotes.
It uses [this quotes API](https://type.fit/api/quotes) to get a JSON array of the quotes along with the authors of those quotes.
It also uses ROOM to save that data in a local database for offline access, and it allows the user to search the quotes by the text of the quote of the author.
